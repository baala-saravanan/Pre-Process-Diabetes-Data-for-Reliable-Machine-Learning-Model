🔎 Title: Pre-Process Diabetes Data for Reliable Machine Learning Model

In my recent assignment, I took a deep dive into data pre-processing to clean, refine, and optimize a diabetes dataset, ensuring it was ready for machine learning models. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process I followed:

📊 1. Data Cleaning & Renaming Columns
🔹 Started by renaming columns like "No_Pation" to "Patients" for clarity and easier understanding.

🔹 Corrected categorical inconsistencies, such as transforming "f" to "F" in the gender column and cleaning extra spaces in labels like "N " and "Y ".

🧼 2. Handling Missing Values
🔹 Identified missing values in critical health metrics like HbA1c, Urea, and Cholesterol.

🔹 Used a targeted median imputation strategy to fill gaps while preserving the integrity of the dataset, especially since these health metrics can exhibit outliers (e.g., extreme cholesterol levels).

📉 3. Statistical Summary & Outlier Detection
🔹 Generated a statistical summary to understand data distribution.

🔹 Employed box plots to identify outliers in key columns like BMI and Age, while selectively retaining clinically significant outliers in health-related columns. For variables like Creatinine and Urea, I filtered extreme outliers beyond the 99.5th and 99.9th percentiles.

⚙️ 4. Feature Engineering
🔹 Applied Label Encoding to transform categorical variables (e.g., gender) into numerical formats.

🔹 Scaled numerical features like Age, BMI, and Creatinine using Standardization, ensuring consistency across the dataset for more accurate model training.

💡 Key Takeaway: Pre-processing plays a critical role in ensuring that data is accurate, consistent, and free from noise, which lays the foundation for building reliable and robust machine learning models. Without this step, model performance could be significantly compromised.
